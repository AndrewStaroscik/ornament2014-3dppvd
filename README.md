===================

stl files for ornaments I created for the [3dppvd contest](http://www.3dppvd.org/wp/2014/12/december-2014-meeting-holiday-party/)

The one I am entring is the striped version. It is a dualstrusion design. To print it the bellPath05StrippedInner.stl and bellPath05stripedOuter.stl files are needed.

More information is provided [on my blog](http://andrewstaroscik.com/views/2014/12/3d-printed-ornament-contest-entry/)
